If aRts is run with realtime priority (this is usually the
default), then there's a good chance that KDE will hang at
logout.  It does here, anyway, and online searching shows
the problem is not Slackware specific.

Until this is fixed upstream, adding this config file will
cause aRts to default to not running realtime.
