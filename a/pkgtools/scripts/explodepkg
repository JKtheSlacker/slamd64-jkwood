Usage: explodepkg package_name [package_name2, ...]

Explodes a Slackware compatible software package (or any tar+gzip archive) in
the current directory.  Equivalent to (for each package listed):

   ( umask 000 ; tar xzvf package_name )

Note: This should only be used for debugging or examining packages, not for 
installing them. It doesn't execute installation scripts or update the package
indexes in /var/log/packages|scripts.
