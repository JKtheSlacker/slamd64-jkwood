# mod_php - PHP Hypertext Preprocessor module
#

# Load the PHP module:
LoadModule php5_module lib/httpd/modules/libphp5.so

# Tell Apache to feed all *.php files through PHP.  If you'd like to
# parse PHP embedded in files with different extensions, comment out
# this line and see the example below.
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

# Tell Apache to feed all *.php, *.html, and *.htm files through
# the PHP module.  Add or subtract extensions here as desired.  Please
# note that running pages through PHP for no reason can be both slow
# and insecure, so be sure to know what you're doing.  It's a convenient
# shortcut, but probably isn't suitible for high-traffic sites if you
# write any of your pages in straight HTML.
#AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html .htm

# This will display PHP files in colored syntax form.  Use with caution.
#AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
