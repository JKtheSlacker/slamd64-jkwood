icecc: Icecream is created by SUSE and is based on ideas and code by distcc.
icecc: Like distcc it takes compile jobs from your (KDE) build and distributes
icecc: it to remote machines allowing a parallel build on several machines
icecc: you've got. But unlike distcc Icecream uses a central server that
icecc: schedules the compile jobs to the fastest free server and is as this
icecc: dynamic.
