unifdef: unifdef - remove preprocessor directives
unifdef: Unifdef is useful for removing #ifdef'ed lines from a file
unifdef: while otherwise leaving the file alone. You specify which
unifdef: symbols are defined or undefined with -D and -U flags, and
unifdef: unifdef removes the corresponding ifdefs, and the enclosed
unifdef: code if appropriate.
