qemu: QEMU (a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.)
qemu: When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made
qemu: for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g.
qemu: your own PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good
qemu: performances. 
qemu: 
qemu: When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by
qemu: executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. A host driver called
qemu: the QEMU accelerator (also known as KQEMU) is needed in this case.
qemu: The virtualizer mode requires that both the host and guest machine
qemu: use x86 compatible processors.
