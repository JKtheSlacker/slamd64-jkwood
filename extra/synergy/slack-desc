# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

synergy: synergy (keyboard/mouse sharing program)
synergy:
synergy: Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
synergy: multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its
synergy: own display, without special hardware. It's intended for users with
synergy: multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its
synergy: own monitor(s). Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as
synergy: moving the mouse off the edge of your screen. Synergy also merges the
synergy: clipboards of all systems into one and synchronizes screen savers.
