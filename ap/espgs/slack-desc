# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

espgs:
espgs: ESP Ghostscript is a customized version of GNU Ghostscript, an
espgs: interpreter of Adobe Systems' PostScript(tm) and Portable Document
espgs: Format (PDF) languages.  Ghostscript is an essential part of the
espgs: printing subsystem, taking PostScript output from applications and
espgs: converting it into an appropriate printer or display format.
espgs: Ghostscript supports many printers directly, and more are supported
espgs: through gimp-print and HPIJS, which are add-on packages that work
espgs: with Ghostscript's IJS driver.
