 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.21, build 4
  * Converted from docbook RPM source builds to direct source build, with
    the build script code by: Jerome Pinot
    based on the Linux From Scratch documentation.
    Merged some of Jerome's code back into the original linuxdoc-tools.build
    script.
    This fixes many bugs with the previous package, with broken catalogs
    and so on.
  * Upgraded to gtk-doc v1.8
  * Upgraded to DocBook SGML DTD v4.5
  * Upgraded to DocBook DSSSL Stylesheets v1.79
  * Upgraded to DocBook XML DTD v4.5
  * Upgraded to DocBook XSL Stylesheets v1.72.0 & docs
  * Added AsciiDoc v8.2.1
  * Added xmlto v0.0.18
  * Removed unused build script code cruft from linuxdoc-tools.build 
  * Re-ordered the build script since OpenSP v1.5.2 requires xmlto,
    and xmlto requires the docbook stuff to be installed.
  * Removed buildDocBookCatalog script.  If you delete your system's SGML or XML
    catalog scripts, thinking that this script can repopulate them, it won't.
    If you're adding docbook data to your system, you need to read the docs that
    come with the new data you're installing.
  * Thanks to Red Hat for the loan of a laptop on which to test this build ;-)
