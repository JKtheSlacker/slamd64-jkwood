# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

bin86: This is a complete 8086 assembler and loader which can make 32-bit
bin86: code for the 386+ processors.  In the past it was used to compile the
bin86: 16-bit bootsector and setup binaries for the kernel, but modern
bin86: (2.4.x or newer) kernels use GNU ld instead.
